[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/michivi/vbf-fs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michivi/vbf-fs/actions)

Various tools for VBF files handling, as found in the Final Fantasy X HD Remaster on PC.

**NOTE**: this project is mainly a personal experimentation.

## Development

Use the command `nix-shell` for a dedicated development shell. Using the `stack` command directly is another option.
